To run the program hit run at the top of the compiler you are using. Login to the application with the username and password "test". After that the program should connect to the database and you should have free rein.

The "generate Report" buttons near the bottom of the application generate reports for the: 
1. Schedule of the contacts in the database. Allowing you to choose a contact from a drop down list and see the appointments coming up for each contact
2. Number of appointments coming up grouped by the type of appointment and the month
3. Number of upcoming appointments for each customer
